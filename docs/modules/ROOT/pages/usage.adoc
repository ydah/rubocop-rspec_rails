= Usage

You need to tell RuboCop to load the RSpec Rails extension.
There are three ways to do this:

== RuboCop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`:

----
require: rubocop-rspec_rails
----

or, if you are using several extensions:

----
require:
  - rubocop-rspec
  - rubocop-rspec_rails
----

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the RuboCop RSpec Rails
cops together with the standard cops.

== Command line

[source,bash]
----
$ rubocop --require rubocop-rspec_rails
----

== Rake task

[source,ruby]
----
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.requires << 'rubocop-rspec_rails'
end
----

== Inspecting files that don't end with `_spec.rb`

By default, `rubocop-rspec_rails` only inspects code within paths ending in `_spec.rb` or including `spec/`. You can override this setting in your config file by setting `Include`:

[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect files in `test/` directory
RSpecRails:
  Include:
    - '**/test/**/*'
----

[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect only files ending with `_test.rb`
RSpecRails:
  Include:
    - '**/*_test.rb'
----

NOTE: Please keep in mind that merge mode for `Include` is set to override the default settings, so if you intend to add a path while keeping the default paths, you should include the default `Include` paths in your configuration.
